      Football Overview
    </h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
      Football, also known as <span class="glow">soccer</span> in some regions, is the <span class="glow">world’s most beloved sport</span>. Played and watched by billions across the globe, it brings together players and fans with a single mission: to <span class="glow">score goals and celebrate teamwork</span>.
      <br><br>
      Each match features <span class="glow">two teams of eleven</span>, including a dedicated goalkeeper for each side. The game follows the <span class="glow">17 Laws of the Game</span>, maintained by IFAB and governed worldwide by FIFA.
      <br><br>
      Games are played on <span class="glow">rectangular fields</span> of grass or artificial turf, with goals at either end. A standard match consists of two <span class="glow">45-minute halves</span>, plus extra time when necessary. Except for goalkeepers in their penalty area, players must rely solely on their feet, head, and body — no hands allowed!
      <br><br>
      Football is celebrated for its <span class="glow">creativity, rhythm, and unpredictability</span>. Iconic tournaments like the <span class="glow">FIFA World Cup</span>, <span class="glow">UEFA Champions League</span>, and <span class="glow">Copa América</span> highlight the best talents the sport has to offer. From spontaneous street matches to packed stadium spectacles, football unites cultures and ignites <span class="glow">passion like no other</span>.
