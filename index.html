  <section id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Football, known as soccer in some countries, is the world’s most popular sport — played and watched by billions of people across every continent. The game is centered around teamwork, skill, and strategy, uniting players and fans under a single goal: to outscore the opponent by getting the ball into the opposing team’s net.

A standard match is played between two teams of eleven players, including one goalkeeper on each side. The game is governed by 17 Laws of the Game, maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) and overseen globally by FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association).

Matches are played on a rectangular grass or turf field, with goals at each end. The game consists of two 45-minute halves, separated by a halftime break. Players use every part of their body except their hands and arms to control and move the ball—goalkeepers being the only exception within their penalty area.

Beyond its simple rules, football is celebrated for its creativity, emotion, and unpredictability. Legendary tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, and Copa América showcase the sport’s best talents and inspire millions. From local street games to global stadiums, football transcends language and culture, symbolizing unity, passion, and perseverance.</p>
