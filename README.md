#3rd Qtr Update#

##Final Title##
Football Website with User Account and Personalization System

##2-Sentence Description##
The Football website now includes a client-side user account system that allows visitors to create an account, log in, and view personalized information. User data is stored locally on the user’s computer using browser localStorage, making the system fully functional without a backend server.

##Features (Minimum of 3)##
User sign-up form that collects and saves account information
Login system that authenticates users using saved data
Personalized profile page displaying user details
Consistent navigation bar across all pages
Client-side data persistence using localStorage

##Details##
The update introduces three new webpages: Sign-Up, Login, and Profile. Users create an account through an HTML form, and JavaScript saves their information as a JSON object in the browser’s localStorage. The login page validates user credentials, while the profile page retrieves and displays stored data. All pages are connected through a unified navigation bar and are compatible with GitHub Pages since no backend server is required.

##Definition of Done##
Users can successfully create an account using the sign-up form
Account data is saved locally on the user’s computer
Users can log in using their saved credentials
Profile page correctly displays stored user information
Navigation works correctly without 404 errors
Project is deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages
